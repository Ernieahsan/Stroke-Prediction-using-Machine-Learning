# Stroke-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
As one of the most debilitating health events to occur to the brain, there is immense need to understand the contextual factors that contribute to stroke occurrences. Using Machine Learning models on stroke data, we can analyze 10 important factors, ranging from gender/age to smoking status, to better uncover what we can do to prevent future occurrences. Before we begin, we must acknowledge Kaggle user “fedesoriano” for the raw data in csv format. Thank you very much for sharing such valuable health information.
Like any comprehensive analysis, it is essential to do some exploratory data analysis to fully understand the design of the dataset as well as its purpose. The dataset is extremely ML friendly, as there is a clear target variable with other columns simply acting as another health factor to dive deeper into. As we jump into the raw csv file, the most important changes to occur was the removal of the id column as well the shift from categorical to discrete variables for all qualitative columns. This was easily accomplished with a simple numbering system, resetting at 0 for each column. With a maximum of 4 qualitative options in a single column, it was a necessary tidbit of hard-coding to ensure that there is full compatibility with future ML models. After these quick fixes, this high quality dataset was essentially ready for ML training.
